## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the OSU AI Bootcamp data sourcing challenge for Module 6. This challenge focuses on pulling data from online API's, specifically the New York Times and the Movie Database.

## Background
The background on this challenge, provided by the course instructors is as follows:
>"..prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods."

## Files
This repository contains four files:
* `retrieve_movie_data.ipynb` - the file that contains the solution for the challenge. This is a Jupyter Notebook.
* `retrieve_movie_data_orig.ipynb` - the original starter file for the challenge. This is for reference only.
* `movies_data.csv` - an export of the data as required by the last step in the Challenge.
* `README.md` - a README file for the repo.

## Technical requirements
The code for the Challenge is in `retrieve_movie_data.ipynb`. This file is a Jupyter Notebook and requires an appropriate jupyter, pandas, and python tooling installed. This can include environmental containers such a anaconda, etc. It can also be executed inside of an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. The code requires python 3.10 or greater.

The file `athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb` is the original starter file provided for the challenge. It is part of the project for reference only. The directory Resources contains the data file client_dataset.csv provided for the challenge.

## Run the code
Assuming a python interpreter is installed and is at least version 3.10 or greater and they jupyter notebook runtime, the program can be executed by calling the jupyter notebook runtime in the directory: E.g., $> jupyter notebook. Once the notebook is running you run each code fragment individually or click on the "Run All" button.

Alternatively it can be executed from within and IDE if the IDE is configured to run python code and is at least 3.10 compatible and a jupyter notebook runtime is installed.
